AndroidRssParser
================

RSS parser designed as a library for Android >=2.1. The design goals
are a footprint as small as possible, RSS v2.0 compliance and, of
course, ease of use.

The library is built on top of the standard SAX parser provided with
Android.

###The parser library depends on
* AndroidApacheCommonsLang
    * [Apache Commons Lang adaptation for
      Android](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/)
* AndroidVersionCompatibility
    * Compatibility tools for supporting older versions of Android
      when compiling against newer.
